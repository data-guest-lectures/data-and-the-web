https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/using-openrefine 

---

# OpenRefine
--

+ In-browser application
--

+ Used to clean data
--

+ Converts data from various file types
--

+ Exports data into various formats

---

# OpenRefine - Pros
--

+ Works with lots of data types
--

+ Great for converting Excel files to CSV (the carriage return problem)
--

+ Facets are powerful (facet on anything)
--

+ Can export to various formats
--

+ Meant specifically to clean data

---

# OpenRefine - Cons
--

+ In browser memory is limited
--

+ Only display 50 rows at a time
--

+ Meant for cleaning data (not displaying it)

---

# How do we access all these APIs?

---

# API Steps
--

+ Make a request
--

+ Get a response
--

## &nbsp;
![img-full](images/api1.png)

---

# Using an API
--

1. Register for API keys
--

2. Use the keys for a request
--

3. Parse the response
--

4. Make beautiful visualizations

---

# Example API Response
